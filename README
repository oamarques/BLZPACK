   The current directory is organized as follows:

   tests   : sample drivers and input files

Purpose:
-------

   BLZPACK (for Block LancZos PACKage) is a set of subprograms written
   in standard Fortran intended for the computation of eigenvalues
   eig and eigenvectors (x) of the "standard" eigenvalue problem

          (A)*(x) - eig*(x) = (0)

   or of the "generalized" eigenvalue problem

          (A)*(x) - eig*(B)*(x) = (0)

   where (A) and (B) are N x N real, sparse, symmetric matrices, eig an
   eigenvalue, and (x) an eigenvector. It is assumed that there exists 
   a linear combination of (A) and (B) which is positive definite to
   guarantee that all eigenvalues are real.

Conditions of use:
-----------------

   BLZPACK has been developed by Osni Marques as a research tool for
   the scientific community. It comes with no guarantee that it is free
   of errors or suitable for a particular application. Therefore, no
   guarantee is given on the results obtained, whose interpretation
   is left to the user. However, comments or reported problems may 
   be sent to:

          OAMarques@lbl.gov

   For an updated list of modifications see file doc/fixes.txt.

Creating libblzpack.a:
---------------------

   BLZPACK  can be installed with make. The configuration needs to be 
   set in the make.inc file. A make.inc for a Linux machine running 
   GNU compilers is given in this. Some specific make.inc are also 
   available in the install directory.

LAPACK and BLAS Kernels:
-----------------------

   The O(N**2) symmetric tridiagonal eigensolvers available in the 
   LAPACK library (version 3.0 or later) can be used to solve the
   reduced symmetric eigenproblem generated by BLZPACK. See the
   make.inc for details.

   A set of BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) kernels is used by 
   libblzpack.a and should be made available when linking the package 
   to a calling program. 

Testing the library:
-------------------

   Test drivers can be generated with 'make exe'; executables are 
   created in the directory tests.
